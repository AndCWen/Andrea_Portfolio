Andrea's Professional Portfolio

## Project 1: [Rocket Launch Capstone Project - IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://github.com/AndCWen/Data_Science_Capstone/tree/main)
- Utilized Python to collect, wrangle, and analyze data to provide the fictitional company "SpaceY" insights on SpaceX's Falcon9 rocket launches.
- Used Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a rocket landing will be successful or not to help "SpaceY" develop a rocket with a high landing success rate.
